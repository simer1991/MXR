MXR created VR tours of several of our home types and we are using this cutting edge technology in our sales centre to help customers to see our home plans in three dimensions. This is a game-changing technology and it offers so much more than traditional 3D/2D drawings. MXR Team has offered us exceptional service and a great deal of advice and guidance as this is relatively new technology and can be intimidating to many. MXR Team is highly recommended and we plan to use them again in the future.”",
