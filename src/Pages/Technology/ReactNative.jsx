       title:"CROSS-PLATFORM",
       text:"Created by the Facebook team, React Native is perfectly suitable for cross-platform mobile app development. Developers can simply write one React Native component, and it will work seamlessly on both Android and iOS. React Native components interact with native APIs, which means it looks and feels like a native app for individual platforms. It is, therefore, a perfect framework for creating platform-specific applications.",

        title:"CODE REUSABILITY",
        text:"React Native is widely known for supporting code reusability. That is, programmers need not write separate codes for separate applications to suit independent platforms. React Native stores components in blocks, and developers can use 90% of these pre-loaded components at any given point in time to write and release new apps and software. The result? Quick development process. Moreover, developers also get the time to focus on other priority tasks.",

The framework enables an Android software to be compiled to suit an iOS platform, and vice-versa, This cuts down on the development time and even reduces the maintenance cost immensely",

As a result, developers can create truly native apps with relevant functionalities, while ensuring top-notch user experience. Uninterrupted access to native APIs also paves the way for the blazing-fast and agile software development process.",

This means that developers can reuse components at any level and at any time, without having to rewrite or recompile the app. As a result, this lets the developers prototype, iterate and release apps quickly, saving them their precious time and cost.",
