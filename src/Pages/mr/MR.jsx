    "360Â° Virtual Reality (VR) Tours became a perfect marketing tool in real estate and design. It is particularly useful for those projects that are still in the development stage or under construction. Regardless of the project location or its stage of completion, a client or an investor has an opportunity not only to see how the project will look like, but also is able to walk around and feel the space. Thousands of brands have created 360 Virtual Reality Tours, including agencies, hotels, destination marketers, corporate recruiters, real estate brokers, photographers, tour operators, and restaurant owners.",
