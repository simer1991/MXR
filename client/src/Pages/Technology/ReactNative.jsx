Developers can simply write one React Native component, and it will work seamlessly on both Android and iOS. React Native components interact with native APIs, which means it looks and feels like a native app for individual platforms. It is, therefore, a perfect framework for creating platform-specific applications.",

React Native stores components in blocks, and developers can use 90% of these pre-loaded components at any given point in time to write and release new apps and software. The result? Quick development process. Moreover, developers also get the time to focus on other priority tasks.",
